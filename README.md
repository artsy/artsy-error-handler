# Artsy Error Handler

## This module is deprecated. With Force merged, modules like Artsy Passport maturing, and more use of Metaphysicsâ€”centralizing common error handling logic like this makes a lot less sense.

Error handling routes for use in Artsy's web apps. Very specific to Artsy's [Ezel](http://ezeljs.com) apps so not very useful for the general public. But hey, _open source by default_!

## Example

````coffeescript
require('artsy-error-handler').handlers app,
    template: resolve(__dirname, '../components/layout/error.jade')
````
